				<h3>Pik Dikt / Dick Poems <br/> av Larry / by Larry <br/>Forlag: Generøsitetens Navlestreng / <br/>Publisher: The Umbilical Cord of Generosity</h3>
				<p>My Dick Has No Eyes<br/>
					For many years it has been this way<br/>
					You could put yourself in another person's place<br/>
					In art especially<br/>
					I can put myself in someone else's place<br/>
					In a woman's place<br/>
					Through art I can describe her from the inside<br/>
					That's how it is<br/>
					People talk so much about “male gaze” but<br/>
					Let's not focus so much on whether one has a penis or not<br/>
					I don't think we´re getting anywhere<br/>
					Would that now change which eyes I see with?<br/>
					I see with human eyes<br/>
					Because strangely enough …<br/>
					My Dick has no eyes</p>

				<p><strong>Pride + Gutta = Eternal Magical Love</strong></p>
				<p>Gutta loves all the queers and is ecstatic to celebrate love. There's a particular letter in LGBTQIA+ that they have a big heart for, namely Lesbians. <br/>By coming out as Lesbros, Gutta finally found their rightful place in the queer struggle. Gutta aren't just making Pride shows and happenings; they're opening all your channels—intellectual, emotional, aesthetic, and sexual. <br/>They invite the audience into a deep, soft, warm, and wet state where you can connect with your innermost desires and discover new sides of yourselves. Together, we'll expand our consciousness, dissolving the boundaries between us. Come and be opened up in our safe embrace, and let's celebrate together.<br/>Gutta gives you everything you didn't know you wanted. They are your new sexuality.<br/>For many years Gutta has tailored shows, happenings, performances, talks and parades for queer contexts. We have been part of Prides in Oslo, Stavanger, Lidköping, Bodø, Træna, Drammen and Trondheim.</p>

				<h2><a href="#worknav">GUTTEKLUBBEN (BOYS CLUB)</a></h2>
				<p>Gutteklubben Goes To Hell was Gutta's contribution to the 50 years anniversary of the decriminalization of the penal code's paragraph number 213; the ban on sex between men in Norway (also known as Queer Culture Year) in 2022. Here we chose to dive into the very pivot point of paragraph 213; the butthole. <br/>Gutta created a delicious sinful hell, where the audience could come in contact  with their innermost desires, and especially their anus. Gutta invited them to get to know sides of themselves and preferences they didn't even know they had. In short, Gutta gave the audience everything they didn't know they wanted.</p>

				<p>Gutta presents: GOD (2020)</p>
				<p>In times of crises the people need strong leaders to look up to. A great patriarch, a stable father figure. Furthermore, we Gutta need the people to gather around us as we go in and out of quarantine, we miss being embraced. Larry, Robin, Lavrans and RichHard seek patriarchal inspiration by calling on the ancestor himself; God.</p>
